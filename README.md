## **Projects**  

### 1. **Pneumonia Detection in X-Ray Images**  
   - **Objective:** Build a model to detect pneumonia in X-ray images using the pre-trained **InceptionV3** model. The model was trained and evaluated using a dataset of lung X-ray images from patients.  
   - **Technologies:** TensorFlow, Keras, Transfer Learning  
   - **Model:** InceptionV3 (Transfer Learning)  
   - **Dataset:** [COVID-19 X-ray Dataset - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khoongweihao/covid19-xray-dataset-train-test-sets/data)  
   - **Real-World Application:** Fast pneumonia diagnosis from X-ray images—an assisted diagnostic tool useful for healthcare professionals, especially in resource-limited areas.  
   - **Project Link:** [Classification Pneumonia - Covid_19](https://github.com/micaelleos/ia-projects-notebooks/blob/main/Classification%20Pneumonia%20-%20Covid_19.ipynb)
